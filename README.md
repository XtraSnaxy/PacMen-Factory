# PacMen-Factory

# Description
This factory duplicates PacMen and sends them flying across the screen. Each PacMan moves with a random velocity and position, and if it has a collision with the limits of the width and height of the screen, its direction will be changed. 

# How To Run
The "Add PacMen" button duplicates the PacMen while the "Start Game" button adds velocity to them to "start" the game. 

# Future Improvements
The future changes to this project will be sound effects, and more realistic animations. This is project is under the MIT License.
