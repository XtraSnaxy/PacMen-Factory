# PacMen-Factory

This factory duplicates PacMen and sends them flying across the screen and bouncing off the window boundaries. The "Add PacMen" button duplicates the PacMen while the "Start Game" button adds velocity to them to "start" the game. The future changes to this project will be sound effects, and more realistic animations. This is project is under the MIT License.
